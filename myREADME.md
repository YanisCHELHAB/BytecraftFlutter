## Flutter challenge 

This is my participation for the challenge given by Bytecraft to join the development department 
It's a simple Login page made with flutter, the puts his username and password in the text fields
and when he clicks on the Login button it takes him into the home page, and he can click on the arrow
on the top to come back to the Login page.
